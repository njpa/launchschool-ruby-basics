# ===
# Create a hash that contains the following data and assign it to a variable 
# named `car`.
#
# type    color   mileage
# -----   -----   -------
# sedan   blue    80_000


# ANSWER
# ======
# We will create a hash with three key-value pairs.  We will use the table
# headers `'type'`, `'color'`, `'mileage'` as keys, and the values `'sedan'`,,
# `'blue'`, `80_000` as their corresponding values.
# We will then initialize a variable name `car` to reference this hash.

car = {type: "sedan", color: "blue", mileage: 80_000}
p car
