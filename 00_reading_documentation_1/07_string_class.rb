# EXERCISE 7
# ==========
# Lets move on now to the documentation you will use most often; the core API 
# section on Classes and Modules. All of these are listed under Classes on the 
# Core API page.

# ANSWER
# ======
# Go to `https://ruby-doc.org` and follow the link to the Core API of your
# ruby version (2.4.4 in this case).  Scroll down past the 'Files' section 
# until you reach the 'Classes' and 'Modules' section.
# HINT: the filter field is quite handy!
# N.B.: the instance methods of the class are displayed with a hashtag 
# preceding the instance method's name and the class methods and module
# methods are preceded by a '::'.
# N.B.: the '::' and '#' notations are documentation conventions and have
# no syntactic effect.  A convenient way of referring to a method is:
# `String#split`, or `String::new`.  This is handy in that (a) it shows the 
# name of the class, the name of the method, and whether the method is a
# class method or an instance method.
