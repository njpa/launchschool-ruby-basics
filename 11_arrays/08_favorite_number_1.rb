# EX 8
# ====
# The following array contains three names and numbers. Group each name with 
# the number following it by placing the pair in their own array. Then create 
# a nested array containing all three groups. What does this look like? 
# # (You don't need to write any code here. Just alter the value shown so it 
# meets the exercise requirements.)

['Dave', 7, 'Miranda', 3, 'Jason', 11]

# ANSWER
# ======
# We will create a multi-dimensional array of two levels.  The first-level
# array will contain three second-level arrays, which in turn will each contain
# a string element and an integer element.

[['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]]
